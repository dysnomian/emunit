#emunit

An experimental unit test framework from the experimental language [Emily].

### Installation

Clone the repo and run `./install`. This installs links the repo to

break it.)

### Usage

Include the framework as follows:

```emily
package.emunit.core
```

### TO DO:

- Basically everything.
- Also documentation

### FAQ

**Q. Isn't EmUnit a remarkable uncreative name?**
Yes, it would be, it that's what it were called, but it's actually pronounced
"emu knit." It's a test to see who uses canonical pronunciations.

### License

MIT license, etc.
